# Hotel Reservation Dashboard

<div align="justify">
The aim of the project is to create an interactive dashboard for a dataset describing hotel reservations in two Portuguese hotels. 
  The dashboard presents the most valuable KPIs including the number of countries which hotels' guests come from and total number of reservations.
  Other visualisations were presented in order to examine the impact of several variables on the decision about cancelling the reservation.
